              description="This project introduces an intelligent vehicle safety system designed to prevent drunk driving. The system uses an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to detect the driver's alcohol level. If the detected level is above a predefined threshold, it disables the vehicle and determines its real-time location via a GPS module. Utilizing Twilio API, the system sends the carâ€™s location to law enforcement or emergency contacts for timely action. By integrating advanced sensor technology and real-time communication, this system aims to reduce drunk-driving incidents and enhance road safety through rapid response and tracking capabilities.
